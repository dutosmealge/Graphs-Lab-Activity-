GRAPHS DATA STRUCTURE 


What It Is?
-	This code defines a simple graph data structure implemented using an adjacency matrix and an array to store vertex data. The graph is undirected, meaning that if there is an edge between two vertices. 

What It Can Do?
-	The application can:
1.	Create a Graph
2.	Add Edges
3.	Assign Data to Vertices
4.	Display Graph Structure

Why did you make that kind of application ?
-	I created this application to demonstrate the implementation of an undirected graph using an adjacency matrix. It serves as an example to:
Show how basic graph operations like adding edges and vertex data work.

How does it contribute to you or to the community?
-	By Understanding how to represent graphs using adjacency matrices is a prerequisite for implementing algorithms like DFS, BFS, or shortest path algorithms.
